## Lab 2:
**Research on Algorithms for Forming and Processing Raster Digital Images**

*Task:* implement a software script that implements the color correction of a digital bitmap image from the list: brightness change, shades of gray, negative, sepia - in gradients: diagonal (any direction); from the center; to the center Processing should be implemented at the level of the raster matrix.

## Lab 9:
**Synthesis of Realistic Objects in Augmented Reality**

*Task:* using the methods of the OpenGL library, develop a script that implements a realistic visualization of the graphic scene in the composition and according to the relationships of the scene objects: in the graphic window there is a 3D polygon in an axonometric projection and a 3D surface model of the second order.
